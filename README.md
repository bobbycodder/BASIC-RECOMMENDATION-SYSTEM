# BASIC-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR GENERAL PURPOSE


I have made basic recommendation system based on weight_average and popularty lavel 
In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for recommendation system

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

# RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 

A recommender system, or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing 'system' with a synonym such as platform or engine), is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.

Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognised examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders. These systems can operate using a single input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating. Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators,and financial services
Recommender systems are the systems that are designed to recommend things to the user based on many different factors. These systems predict the most likely product that the users are most likely to purchase and are of interest to. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc.

There are majorly six types of recommender systems which work primarily in the Media and Entertainment industry: Collaborative Recommender system, Content-based recommender system, Demographic based recommender system, Utility based recommender system, Knowledge based recommender system and Hybrid recommender system.
